            <p>I choose this topic because I want to make a website for my parents' business.
                I could also contribute to my family's business and that the customer can see
                what are the products that are being displayed in the store.</p>

            <p>I will download the content, especially pictures that are free to use or pictures that
                I own. I will only collect pictures that are free licensed so that I will not get a copystrike
                on my webpage.
            </p>

            <h1>I promise I will not copy my classmates project and change the content.
                I should make my own HTML and CSS. If I copy others work, I will get an automatic F in the course.
