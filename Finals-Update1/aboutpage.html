                <p>Sari Sari Store  anglicized as neighborhood sundry store, is a convenience store found in the Philippines. 
                    The word sari-sari is Tagalog meaning "variety" or "sundry". Such stores occupy an important economic 
                    and social location in a Filipino community and are ubiquitous in neighborhoods and along streets.</p>
                <p>SC3 sari sari store is the acronym after the 3 kids (Sidney Clark, Sheldon Charles, Shandy Claire)
                     of the couple John and Bebilyn Ordonia.</p>
                <p>SC sari-sari store is a small neighborhood retail shop that caters to members of that community. 
                    The store usually carries basic goods such as frozen foods, canned food, instant noodles, cooking oils, eggs,
                      beverages, toiletries, snacks like (bread, biscuits)  rice in kilo or sack, basic needs of school supplies, basic 
                      cosmetics, basic medical supplies and other things that Filipinos get on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>SC Sari Sari Store or neighborhood stores are the go-to for most Filipinos for their daily necessities. 
                    By selling products in small quantities, sari-sari stores enable households with a meager income to purchase their needs for the day.</p>
                <p>The sari-sari store provides easy access to basic commodities at low cost. Without them, villagers must go to the nearest market town, 
                    which may be quite far from the village itself. In the Philippines, following the concept of tingi or retail, a customer can buy 'units' of the product rather than whole package.</p>
